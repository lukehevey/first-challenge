# Refactored Marketing Webpage


## Description 
The reason behind this project was to refactor the already finished code, and make sure it follows accessibility standards. The code beforehand did not follow accesibility standards, and was not comprehensible. The sole purpose was to make sure the site is optimized for search engines. I was able to learn how to work with fully finished code to figure out what can be done to make it better.
